            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The Craft Barbershop</p>
            
            <p>The Craft is a barbershop that specializes in creating a classic, laid-back experience for its patrons. Patrons can enjoy a glass of beer or wine during their haircut and enjoy great conversation.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience would be adults who value quality haircuts.</p>
           
            <p>Their primary tasks would likely be to schedule appointments with barbers and see how much it costs to get a haircut at The Craft. Another task as well would be to look for contact information and the location of the business.</p>
