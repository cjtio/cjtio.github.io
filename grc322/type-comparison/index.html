      <p>Clarendon is a slab serif typeface designed in 1845 by Robert Besley in London, UK. It was acquired by many other foundries, with the Adobe version being owned by URW Type Foundry, which is based in Germany. It is characterized as bold and sturdy, having a large x-height, strong serifs, and minor contrast in thickness. <br>
        <br>Clarendon was the first typeface to ever be patented. Since the patent only lasted three years, it was quickly acquired by many other foundries. In the 20th century, many new versions or revivals were made to Clarendon, catering to different widths, weights, and styles.

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-summary1.png" alt="Comparison of Clarendon and Sutro in regular weight.">
        <figcaption>When set in the same size, Clarendon and Sutro look similar, but upon further inspection, are distinct. Sutro is slightly more condensed and thinner than Clarendon at regular weight.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-summary2.png" alt="Comparison of Clarendon and Sutro in full uppercase, regular weight.">
        <figcaption>The contrast between thick and thin strokes is apparent in Sutro’s uppercase. Clarendon feels like a consistent weight despite small variations in the stroke thickness.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-summary-num.png" alt="Summary of the numbers and punctuation characters between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s numerals strive for attention, with each one commanding enough space to take center stage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <!-- Use as many images as you need. -->
      <h3>Lowercase characters</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-lower-a.png" alt="Comparison of the 'a' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon features curled terminals and smooth joints, while Sutro’s terminals and joints are sharp.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-lower-d.png" alt="Comparison of the 'd' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s roots in wood-block type shows through with its horizontal serifs and rectangular bowl. On the other hand, Sutro’s serifs angle upwards at a 3-6º angle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-lower-g.png" alt="Comparison of the 'g' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s curls make an appearance on the ear of the lowercase ‘g’. Sutro maintains a slant in the counters, while Clarendon keeps them level.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-lower-v.png" alt="Comparison of the 'v' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>While the vertices of Clarendon and Sutro’s lowercase ‘v’ are similar, the joints between their arms and serifs differ by their roundness or sharpness.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-lower-oe.png" alt="Comparison of the 'o' and 'e' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>When laid on top of each other, Clarendon’s heavier and more square nature becomes apparent. Sutro achieves a more contemporary look with thinner strokes and open feel. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Uppercase characters</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-upper-a.png" alt="Comparison of the 'A' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Compared to Sutro, Clarendon’s more even thickness contributes to a blockier feel. Sutro opens up with thinner lines, more white space, and machine-sharp angles.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-upper-e.png" alt="Comparison of the 'E' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Focusing on the negative space of the two typefaces’ uppercase ‘E’, we see that Clarendon’s curves contribute significantly to the letter’s weight. Sutro’s sharp corners feel machine-made, while Clarendon’s inner corners look carved by hand.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-upper-g.png" alt="Comparison of the 'G' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon and Sutro are similar with the lower spurs on the uppercase ‘G’, but Clarendon’s upper spur mirrors its bottom while Sutro opts for an unembellished serif. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-upper-h.png" alt="Comparison of the 'H' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s uppercase ‘H’ feels heavier with thicker stems and crossbar, as well as rounded joints taking up more space than Sutro’s 90º angles.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-upper-sd.png" alt="Comparison of the 'S' and 'D' characters between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>In a progression to cut down fluff, Sutro has purely rectangular serifs. Meanwhile, Clarendon adds rounded corners and additional faces to serifs.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Punctuation characters and numbers</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-punc.png" alt="Comparison of the '!' and '?' characters between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s punctuation rarely resorts to sharp angles, preferring flowing lines ending in curls (where possible). Sutro takes the opposite stance, preferring sharp angles to rounded corners.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-2.png" alt="Comparison of the '2' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Sutro’s numerals maintain slight angles and sharp corners at their terminals; meanwhile, Clarendon introduces curls at nearly every opportunity.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-3.png" alt="Comparison of the '3' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon’s numeral ‘3’ forms a proper handlebar mustache, while Sutro’s opts for less embellishment.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-7.png" alt="Comparison of the '7' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>In the numeral ‘7’, Clarendon emphasizes curves and waves but terminates with an upper spur. Sutro mixes curves and hard angles for a modern evolution of slab-serif fonts.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-48.png" alt="Comparison of the '4' and '8' characters between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <figcaption>Clarendon and Sutro’s silhouettes are similar, but Sutro’s slimmer, more contemporary lines differentiate the two. Clarendon maintains horizontal/vertical lines throughout the character forms while Sutro terminates at an angle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Main takeaways</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/comp-highlight.png" alt="Comparison of the 'H' character between Clarendon and Sutro.">
        <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <figcaption>The most prominent similarities are the periods, the spurs, and the presence of serifs. Since Clarendon and Sutro are both slab serif typefaces, they both have serifs and similar spurs, even if the serifs may look different. Additionally, the periods on their punctuation characters are both circular.</figcaption>
        <h3>Differences</h3>
        <figcaption>The most prominent differences between Clarendon and Sutro are the terminals, the serifs, the counters, and the width of the crossbars. Clarendon’s terminals are rounded, whereas Sutro’s terminals are flat. The distance between the serifs of the uppercase H is wider for Sutro than for Clarendon, giving Clarendon a heavier look. The width of the crossbars for Sutro is thinner. The counters for Sutro are generally wider than those for Clarendon.</figcaption>
